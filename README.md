Visualizing the popularity of python repositories

Example taken from Eric Matthis' book from Starch Press

This simple API script visualizes the popularity of python repositories by 
counting the number of 'stars' each repository has and setting them to 
a bar graph using pygal. The output file is an svg file that you can be opened
on Firefox. 

Neat stuff for a smooth-brained ape like myself.
